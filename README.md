### Description

This plugin implements discoverable graveyards. Players will respawn at the nearest graveyard location that they have previously discovered, with temporary immunity from mob attack.

### Features

*   Create hidden graveyards that require discovery, or unhidden that are always available.
*   Enable or disable graveyards individually, without deleting them (to make a graveyard temporarily unavailable, for instance).
*   Custom discovery message per graveyard location, or use the default message in the customizable language file.
*   Custom respawn message per graveyard location, or use the default message in the customizable language file.
*   Safety cooldown prevents mobs from attacking after respawn for a configurable amount of time. Per graveyard setting overrides default in configuration file.
*   Customizable discovery range, can be set per graveyard location or use configured default.
*   Teleport command allows admins to instantly travel to any graveyard.
*   Group permissions setting per graveyard, so graveyards can be made available only to players within a certain group.
*   Intelligent tab completion for all commands.
*   Custom messages and language localization.
*   Per world enabled in configuration.
*   Uses sqlite for persistent storage.
*   A perfect compliment to [SavageDeathChest](https://github.com/tim-savage/SavageDeathChest) and [SavageDeathCompass](https://github.com/tim-savage/SavageDeathCompass).
